# ListsOfDrinks
CSC-1310 Lab 2 (Dalton Cantrell, Justing Dieter, Brody Mensonides)

Program description: This program will give the user access to a library of drinks, which contains categorizations as well as recipes.

There are options to both read and edit existing libraries as well as create new libraries, with all data stored on .txt files in the following format with (*) used as a delimiter:

Name (Drink 1)  * Alcohol Percentage (Drink 1) * Pairing (Drink 1) * # Ingredients (Drink 1) * Ingredients 1*2*3*etc. (Drink 1) * Glassware (Drink 1) * Instructions (Drink 1) *


Name (Drink 2)  * Alcohol Percentage (Drink 2) * Pairing (Drink 2) * # Ingredients (Drink 2) * Ingredients 1*2*3*etc. (Drink 2) * Glassware (Drink 2) * Instructions (Drink 2) *

etc.


FOR INSTRUCTORS: the TEST_CASE.txt functions as intended, although not having inputs shown via this method makes some parts of the program look wonky.
